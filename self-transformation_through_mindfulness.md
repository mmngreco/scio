- String of moments: sustaining out mental habits and dispositions

A moment: perception + sensory awareness + evaluation (500ms)

- **perception**: filter information relevant and prepare for action.
  (subcortical regions)
- **sensory awareness**: Integrating information from perception and awareness
  and prepare inferences and predictions to inform out **behaviour**.
  (primary sensory cortices)
- **evaluation**: awareness arises and then we begin to evaluate what it is
  we're experiencing. (pre-frontal cortex)


**String of moments**: sustaining out mental habits and dispositions that are
self-conditioning and self-perpetuating through repetition. It's continually
informing our preset state of awareness and coloring our memories for the past
and making predictions for the future.


    (me) <---> (me) <---> (me) <---> (me) <---> (me)

What happened when we take a bad decision. [this reminds me to Dan Ariely's experiment about Donkey donuts vs Starbucks]

**Meta-Awareness**: Refers to an awareness of where our attention is. It acts
as a wedge to open up our minds and provide insight into the mental habits that
are arising again and again.


Cite:
    "Mindfulness is the thin edge of a wedge that, if inserted deeply enough
    into our minds, will open them to wisdom."
    - Andrew Olendzki, Tricycle Magazine, 2015


**Wisdom**: Direct experience with our mental habits.


Wisdom for Anger, it was the sensory awareness in the body:

- tightness
- clenched fists
- impulse to act


Others examples :

- Anger
- Anxiety & Fear
- Worry
- Sadness

All have the tendency to be destructive mental habits and dispositions:

- High Frequency
- Risk of injury
- Interference Socially

Cause:

- Depression
- Anxiety
- Cardiovascular disease
- Cellular Aging

> Gallo & Matthews, 2003, Razanski
> Blumenthal & Kaplan, 19999, Rugulies, 2002

Mindfulness helps to Wisdom and Awareness work together.


Example of Fibromyalgia: The patients improve by practicing mindfulness. But
how the process is?


## Experiment

Trained vs Non-trained people in mindfulness


Exposed to pain-related words.

Perception level: 100 ms

- Untrained : avoid the words
- Trained : approach to the words

Evaluation level: 500 ms

- untrained : ruminate
- trained : let it go


> Vago & Nakamura, 2011


## Scan the brain's structure


- Frontopolar cortex
- Dorsal anterior cingulate cortex
- Anterior insular cortex
- PCC (rumination)
