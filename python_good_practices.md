I like minimal and simple templates which can be easily adopted and adapted
without thinking too much about options. The main goal is it should be updated
and follow the PyPA standars (using eg. `pyproject.toml`, `src`, etc...)

# Templating with conventions

# Templating Tools

- https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter
- https://github.com/cruft/cruft
- https://github.com/copier-org/copier

Cookiecutter is wide extended and it's easy to use.

Cruft claims to be the same as cookiecutter is with the hability to keep update
templates outputs which is great and very useful.

Copier is so simple, it's just a CLI that replace text.
